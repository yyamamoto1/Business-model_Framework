## 1. The Big Picture
We develop and provide "Simple Collab," an ultimately simple, all-in-one collaboration tool for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Japan that struggle with IT. We aim to support the productivity improvement of countless SMEs left behind by the wave of digital transformation (DX) and, in turn, boost Japan's overall competitiveness.
